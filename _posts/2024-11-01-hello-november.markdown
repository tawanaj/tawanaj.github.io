Hello hello :wave:

Wow, I cannot believe it's already November! This is my favorite time of year. Between my birthday, various holidays and just getting to spend focused quality time with loved ones, it's always life giving! Also, the weather is amazing.

Nashville has 2 great weeks for incredible weather: **the last week of October** and the **first week of November**. Before then, it's way too hot and after, it's too chilly. The foliage is currently foliage-ing :fallen_leaf:.

In any case, I am so grateful to be here!

Last month while on sabbatical in Europe :earth_africa:, I celebrated my 29th birthday!
 
 On my birthday and honestly throughout the entire trip, I felt such a sense of pride for how I was living my life.  I felt so **proud to be ME**; someone who is self aware, balanced, empathetic, beautiful, kind, fiscally responsible and just an incredibly strong person. 
 
 I had never felt that much pride for me, **ever**. It was probably due to the fact that I was solo traveling which forces you to be more self aware than normal. But I'll take it.

Today, I'm reminded of that pride that I felt and still feel. So much so, that I've been smiling more than normal. 

So today I have no earth shattering epiphany for you. Just some questions :thought_balloon:: 

> <u>Are you living a life that you're proud of?</u>

> Where are you compromising as it pertains to your own happiness?

> What can you do for yourself perpetually to remind your heart of how incredible you are?

You only get one life. Live one that is worthy of you!

Cheers to the weekend friend from afar :wine_glass:
