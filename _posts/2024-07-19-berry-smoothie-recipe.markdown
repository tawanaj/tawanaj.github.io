If you are a sucker for a good banana and strawberry smoothie, I have a pretty easy recipe for ya. This recipe is a hit throughout the week. It's creamy and delicious :yum: and makes for a great breakfast supplement, post workout drink or midday snack. 

## Ingredients 
* 1/4 cup frozen blueberries
* 1/2 cup frozen strawberries
* 1 banana
* 1 cup oat milk
* 1/4 cup of water
* 1 scoop of your favorite protein powder

</div> 

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; width:100%; height:100%; margin-top: 2rem;">
  <img src="/assets/blender.jpg"  style ="border-radius:2rem;" alt="timeout gif">
  <span style="display: flex; align-self: center; margin-top:1rem; font-weight: bold;">Full size Nutribullet and smoothie cup</span>
</div> <br>

### Important notes: 

> You'll need a smaller Nutribullet sized or full size blender. **Please note my measurements are for the Nutribullet smoothie cups that attach to the full size blender as pictured above!** If you are using a Nutribullet, I would trim the measurements by a fourth. 

> I like to use the Ascent Whey protein brand. I've found that it has the best consistency and my body responds to it a bit better. But any protein powder will do!

> **Oat milk is key here for optimal creaminess :icecream:.** But you can supplement this with whatever beverage suits your dietary needs.

## Steps 

1. Combine fruit with liquids in blender (ensure the frozen fruit is closest to the blade)
2. Add protein powder
3. Blend away 



Vwala :sparkles: you should have yourself an incredible smoothie! Enjoy.
