I am heading out on vacation this weekend :raised_hands:. I'm really looking forward to sitting on a beach and catching up with old friends. 

Because of the pending travel, this week has been jam packed with things to get done.

I wanted to share some things I have found that have helped me to truly prepare my heart, mind, body to disconnect. 

#### 1. Eat well, :weight_lifting_woman: exercise and sleep :sleeping_bed:

Eating well is key to keeping your body fueled for your workouts. It also helps to regulate your bowel movements leading up to travel! 

The better I sleep week of travel, the better my sleep is when I arrive. Try to get some sleep!

When I keep my routine in tact before travel, I feel like I can actually un wind. It's almost like  a reward for all the hard work I've done leading up to the trip lol.

#### 2. Make myself a todo :scroll: list 

I like to ask myself the following questions the weekend before travel: 

>What are the things that absolutely need to get done before I leave? What are the things that would be nice to get done? What are the things that can 100% wait until I get back? 

Based off of my response to these questions, I'll create tasks and will try to schedule them for different days of the week.

#### 3. Give my plants a good watering :potted_plant:

I am a plant mom to several types of plants with different watering needs. I try to give them all a good watering the day before I go (one of my todos). And depending on how long I'm gone for, I'll pre schedule friends to come and water them while I am away.

#### 4. Wash my sheets and clean my :bath: bathroom

There is nothing quite like coming home to a clean house, let alone clean sheets. Honestly, if you don't have it in you to clean the entire house before you go, **that is ok**! I would aim for those sheets though. It is such a good feeling curling up in bed after a long travel day (sometimes I need a vacation from the travel day) with sheets that smell of gain.

Next best thing, is a clean bathroom. Cleaning the bathroom is up there as my LEAST favorite chore. But after being away, having all your personal spaces clean, can help reduce the amount of things to get done as you head into the normal rhythm of your week. 

#### 5. Pamper me :nail_care:

I will usually make appointments for a mani/pedi, hair, eyebrow threading and shopping to get clothes or gadgets for myself. 

This sets me up for success. When I look good, I feel good. I feel so confident in my stride like **"yes sir I know I'm that girl"** :clap:

#### 6. Find my passport :open_book:

Am I the only one who has to prioritize searching for their passport? It never fails. If I don't give myself ample time to search, I may push it off till the night before. There is nothing more stressful than trying to find your passport the night before travel :sweat:

#### 7. Journal 

I try to make time to process anything that is going on internally. I set some hopes for my upcoming trip, things that I desire to see happen, things that I am wanting as a result of my rest.

This has worked wonders for my travels. `If you never actually take time to process, you're just letting life happen to you. `

I try to continue my journaling while im traveling. It is amazing how much sweeter explorations are when you take time to **document them in private for the benefit of no one but yourself**. 

#### 8. **Pray** :pray:

One of my favorite passages of scripture is Matthew 11:28-30. It reads:

>28 “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”

Rest begins and ends with Jesus. Rest is a gift given to us. Rest is mine to have and partake in as a child of God. **Rest is not circumstantial to being on vacation.** `It is a life lived doing things Gods way.` And as I do them his way, ***I am refueled on a daily basis by his spirit and given the grace to live in abundance.***

Spending time with him, grounds me. It re focuses my heart and mind to the reality that `his presence will always be the goal`. Travel is great but seeing the world, his world, with eyes full of awe and wonder to what God has made, is truly the most life giving thing. 


Here's a snippet of what I am actually praying this week as I prepare to travel: 

> God thank you that I get to vacation. Would you come? Everything is so much better with you than without. I pray for sweet moments of laughter and joy with the community you've given me. I pray for tangible encounters amongst us, as we cook breakfast, eat dinners, lay on the beach and do nothing. May you come and fill our hearts with the utmost gratitude. May we leave with a deeper revelation of what it looks like to rest. <br>In Jesus name,<br>amen


Alright, I actually have to go find my passport now lol. 

Here's to rest, `may we find it, bask in it and make it a way of life`.


Over and out :v:
