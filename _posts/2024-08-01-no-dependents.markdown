I was dog sitting for a friend this week and I'm pretty sure he qualifies as the laziest dog on the planet. His name was Ghena. He is what I call a professional sleeper. He starts his days with a nice pee and poop at 8AM and then by 9AM, he clocks in to his first sleep shift. Around 4PM or so, he'll start to come alive, then will be wide awake and ready to be walked again at 6PM. By 7:30PM, he is back in bed, ready to start the second sleep shift of the day :laughing:. Watching his sleep patterns was the funniest thing.

It was nice having a fur friend around the house!

However, the last 2 weeks have been stressful. There has been so much going on in all my worlds (personal, family and professional). Coming home or waking up knowing that my first task was taking care of someone else's needs, felt like a burden. Of course if these were boring weeks with nothing really going on, I probably would not have felt this way. 

But there were moments where I felt true resentment towards Ghena. It didn't last very long because he would do something funny or do nothing at all but sleep which was even funnier :laughing:.

All of this got be me thinking about where I am in my life right now. 
>What is it that I want?

I can't be sure I know what that is. 
>But I do know one thing for certain, I am not in a place where I desire to take care of someone or something else. 

Life is constantly lifing and I am just trying to keep up. 

I don't want to have any sort of dependent right now. I thoroughly enjoy my freedom. I love getting to decide what I do or don't do on the weekends. I love being able to take extravagant vacations or impromptu trips visiting family or friends, without having to think twice about where I am going to leave the dog while I'm away or taking the tiny humans into account when planning trips. 

I am enjoying my life just the way it is right now. 

Knowing that one day, this will not be my reality. One day, I'll be tag teaming with hubby to get the kids ready for school, packing lunches, letting the dog out, planning family trips, attending my kids sporting events on the weekend and of course tending to my relationship with my spouse. 

> Life will be full. For that time. 

But

> Life is just as full now. 

It might look a lot different. The days are slower. I get more time to myself and to sleep in (cherishing this while I have it :brown_heart:). But it is equally as full. 


**`Enjoy life's reality for what it is in this season, knowing that it may not always be that way.`**

If school drop off, keeping the tiniest of humans alive, caring for your family, etc is your reality, I love this for you :clap:. There is so much beauty in where you are. 

If you are living your best single/dating adult life, traveling freely (or not), starting your career, figuring out what your hobbies are, making/keeping up with friends, lounging on the weekends, spoiling your fur babies, I love this for us :heart:. 

Cheers to the weekend :tropical_drink:, may we all cherish it for what it is.
