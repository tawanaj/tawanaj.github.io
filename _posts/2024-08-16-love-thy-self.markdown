At the beginning of 2023, I set out to learn how to love myself. I was at a place in my life where I was truly struggling to do basic things like giving myself grace or showing self compassion. And it wasn't until I realized in therapy, that I had never learned how. I hadn't learned how to properly love me.

It's one of those things that aren't written clearly in black and white. There is no manual to read like there is when you buy an appliance. 

So I embarked on a journey :airplane: of self discovery that has carried over into my present day. 

Learning to love me has been so complex. 
<h3 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">*****</h3>

**It started off with dismantling my definition of love.** My faith teaches me that the same way in which I love myself, I ought to love my neighbor and God. So I backed up and tried to analyze 2 things: 

> How does God love me? 
<br><br>
> How do I love others? 

I took all the findings and figured I'd just tangibly apply that to myself. 

And what I learned was that **love is action**. **<u>It is consistent, targeted pursuit of me</u>**. It is care and affection 100000 times repeated. It is being kind to me :cherry_blossom:. It is feeling empathy for me. It is showing grace to me. It is showing quick patience in moments where I am agitated with me. In all things, it is action. **Action towards me in the form of deep devotion.** 

<h3 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">*****</h3>
The next stage of my quest was **grief**. I was bombarded with it. I had to grieve what I didn't get to learn as a kid and that I didn't have stable enough parents to teach me. No one taught me how to do this. If anything, the exact opposite was embodied. Shame and judgement ran rampant in our household. 

So I had to shed a few tears :teddy_bear:, write several angry journals and release my parents from my heart. **And let it go.** I was no longer a child. I had to move on to tend to present day Tawana. 

<h3 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">*****</h3>

Ahhh. Now that I had somewhat of a clean slate. I had to figure out how to tangibly apply what I had learned love to be. How the heck would I pursue myself? In a not weird way lol. 

**Kindness, empathy, grace, patience, consistency are all things that embody self care.** How I prioritized myself had to change. Because I was trying to reshape my overall view of me. 

One of the first things I did was **open up a self care account**. And I put $50 a month into it. This is not to insinuate that all forms of self care require lavish spending but I had to put my money where my mouth was. *Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also, Matthew 6:21*.

 I had to invest in myself in some form. The same way that I paid my mortgage every month to have a place to live, I needed to apply that same level of need to myself. 

 These were funds that I would spend freely on anything that I wanted to do for myself. For a while, this looked like treating myself to a movie night, taking myself to breakfast, getting my eyebrows done. Small things. 
 
 That budget has now quadrupled. At first I struggled to figure out how to celebrate myself. But soon, it became one of my favorite things to do. I look forward to planning my date nights lol. Some of these are now embedded in my normal schedule. **I was learning how to tangibly, treasure me.**
  
  Today my self care spending looks like me getting my nails done, taking myself out to dinner or my favorite brunch spot and people watching, going to the spa, ordering myself flowers 	:bouquet:, making a really nice dinner at home and enjoying my favorite wine, having painting with a twist dates with myself, **writing myself thank you letters and leaving them around the house** (good for the soul :purple_heart:), etc. 

It took time, but in time, I realized that this new found definition of love that seemed so intangible was truly becoming a reality. I was loving Tawana, no matter what. 

<h3 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">*****</h3>
The next thing I did was **prioritize learning and understanding my own body**. I read several women's health books that sought to explain the female cycle. I started keeping track of my period and taking note of what I was feeling. I changed my diet to better support not just my workouts but also my cycle. I educated myself on female sexual and mental health.

 As I took time to read and learn, not only did I feel better but I watched as lies that I had believed about my body, body image, my sex drive, sexuality, all began to change. 

There was so much shame tied to this area of my life. A lot it was learned shame. I grew up in a church and home where toxic religious and cultural beliefs about women were held as the standard. I also had a parent who was a down right misogynist.

So needless to say, there were a web of lies to unravel. The combination of learning fundamental and biological truths helped to shape a new view of myself. A lot of honest prayers were prayed, tears shed, hard conversations had with myself, my therapist, God but a lot of it with myself. 

This really fueled my ability to show myself grace, patience and empathy. I understood why things were, where things were and how they were. It has given me a new found freedom and self awareness.


<h3 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">*****</h3>

Next phase was figuring out how to keep what I had been learning a part of my norm. 

**Boundaries.**

I read a book on boundaries (noted below) that flipped a lot of things on its head and was a true turning point for me. So much of what I was afraid to admit out loud, was made clear and validated in this book. 

I felt the freedom to fight for myself and the new found space that I was creating. **Boundaries are needed to protect your heart and self.** It is a facet of love that we often don't talk about much - self respect. 

I started saying no. I stopped pleasing people around me for the heck of it. I prioritized myself and my own needs not in a selfish way but again going back to the mortgage example, meeting the basic need of wanting to be healthy. I learned how to set boundaries with my family, with friends and with myself! **<u>Yes you can set boundaries with yourself.</u>**

<h3 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">*****</h3>

**I love me.** 

That statement carries so much more meaning now because I truly live it out. It's crazy what staying consistent will do. 

I love that I take myself on long hikes on the weekends to clear my head, pray, enjoy nature and give thanks for all that I accomplished during the week. I love that I have learned to prioritize my calendar (if I'm booked - even if its a date night with myself - sorry I will not reschedule).  I love my body :brown_heart:! All of its nuances, it makes me, me! I love my laugh, I find myself hearing it more often in my down time or with friends.

> **I am fully committed to myself.**

I didn't know what a statement like that could mean until I put me first. 




Funny enough, I find that I am a much better friend now than I ever was. I am more attentive, intentional and patient. 

`As I have learned to love myself, I can now love others with a similar devotion.`
