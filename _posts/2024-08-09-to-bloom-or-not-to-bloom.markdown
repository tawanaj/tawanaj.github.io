This summer heat has been very wild. From record high temps to extreme humidity, the sun is truly sunning :sun_with_face:.

As a result of all the heat, my Hydrangeas were burnt to a crisp. My grass was also dying. But in the last 3 weeks or so, we've gotten a ton of rain. And I've noticed my grass has been quickly restored to spring like colors and height. And my Hydrangeas are still burnt to a crisp but new flowers and leaves have begun to bud.

The same day that I noticed the newest flower, I was not in the best of moods. I was so drained and overwhelmed with things that were happening. I felt like there were so many things outside of my control. And I was also processing some disappointing turn of events that happened a couple days earlier.

I usually stay pretty active throughout the day but not that day lol. I also decided that I was going to eat my feelings and finished an entire bag of cheetos puffs. I messaged a friend (who also happens to be my accountability partner) and told her how terrible I'd been feeling and that I needed to get to the gym.

And thankfully, I got my butt to the 4:30pm class. And I ended up crushing the days workout (it was a spicy one :hot_face:). After class, this friend and I went for a nice long walk and talked through some things. 

At the end of our walk, my friend shared her appreciation for our friendship and we both got a little emotional :smiling_face_with_tear:.

I could not stop smiling on my drive home. And that is when I saw my Hydrangeas as I made my way to the front door.

> **Good can always be found even in the worst situations.**

I love that all you see is brown and green and a random spot of white on my shrub. That is where my eyes go, despite the burning leaves.

In what could have easily ended up being a terrible day, it turned out to be one of the best of the week. I found such good by the end of the day despite the heavy things happening around me. I got a workout in, I spent time with a friend and I felt better about things after releasing some endorphins. 

<br>

> **Being fruitful does not depend on how good your situation is. But rather it depends on you keeping your disposition and commitments in the midst of situations. And as you do so, fruit follows.**

Despite the scourging heat and burning leaves, my Hydrangea plant is producing fruit. It has kept its disposition by being firmly planted in the ground :potted_plant:.

My commitment to keeping my routine, helped me to be fruitful. It wasn't that long ago where a terrible day would've ended a lot differently for me. I would have gone back to some addictive habits. But getting to the gym, vocalizing where I was emotionally with a friend and  just talking through it, helped me keep my disposition of chosen sobriety. **Producing fruit in the form of a healthy body and mind.**

 <br>

> **How things start, wont be how they end**

Even in the midst of its dying counterparts, a flower began to bud on my Hydrangea plant. 

How my day ended wasn't how it started. Driving away from the gym that night, I was smiling. I realized that I was living a prayer.  Spending time with this friend, reminded me of how far I've come. There was a time where I didn't find myself worthy of friends after a massive mistake. I carried the shame of this mistake for many years. And it impacted my ability or desire to make new friends. Well this friend sharing her feelings with me, was proof that my past was my past. And I have done so much inner work to heal and to be a better version of myself. 

I am worthy of friends. I am capable of maintaining loving relationships. It wasn't that long ago where I didn't believe that. I am grateful for this friend. She has easily become one of my favorite humans :brown_heart: and a huge part of my healing journey.

God really does make things beautiful in time. That day, was the quickest turn around I've seen of this statement lol. But it was a culmination of dreams and prayers realized for many years. Years that I spent battling an addictive habit, years that I spent self loathing due to mistakes made, years that I prayed for Godly friends and years that I have spent in therapy. 

Man my heart is truly full. I am grateful. 

Who knew that the sight of a flower would have such an effect lol.

Let's hope my hydrangeas stay alive in this next heat wave :blossom:	:bouquet:
