I love Reddit. It has become my only form of social media in the last year and a half. The idea that you can troll the internet completely anonymously is genius. I'm in a series of adulting threads. And this week someone posed the question: 

>Single over 30, who do you live with?

One of the comments were:

>Alone. Its lonely at times but love it 99% of the time. I feel lucky to be able to afford it in this economy.

Someone replied to this comment and said

> Yes, I love and hate the pressure I feel at times but when I'm enjoying a glass of wine and binging a good show, I realize its all worth it. :smile:

I was reading this on my couch after I had just had dinner, a long productive day and was enjoying the silence. I resonated so much with this persons take on living alone.

 It got me thinking about my own home ownership journey, the stress, the joy, the frustrations, the fears, the beauty, the bravery, the inconveniences, the opportunities, the tax breaks, the financial burden at times, all of it. 
 
 Amidst all the peaks and valleys in the journey, I would not change a single thing. My home has truly become my safe haven. Every room has my own decorative touch to it. All my plant children were carefully curated to fit the aesthetic. After travel, a long day, being around tiny humans, or just because, there's nothing I long for more, than to come home. 

 There's nothing like having a cup of tea in the morning, sitting in my recliner in my backyard as the sun rises. There's a quiet all around. The birds are chirping. Grass is grassing. I'm filled with such gratitude in my heart that compels me to pray prayers of thanksgiving and praise to my God. There's a stillness that comes over me that I cant quite put into words. My only hope is that everyone gets to have this experience.

 Home wasn't always an oasis. Growing up, home was a desolate, dark, triggering, ominous place. I dreaded being there. As a teen, I would sign up for every extra curricular activity there was both in school and at my home church, just so I wouldn't have to go home. The environment was toxic in every way and made for some pretty hazardous conditions. 

 It took for me to be **out of that environment**, to realize how unhealthy it was. *And also, lots of processing in therapy.* But there's something about being away from toxicity, that somehow sobers you up. ***And makes you see the error in where you were.*** 

**`Living alone has brought a facet to my healing journey that I didn't even know I needed.`**

Cultivating a healthy environment that is just for me, has helped me:

- Identify unhealthy situations
- Enforce boundaries with myself **and with others**
- **Give my inner child space to grieve what she did not have**
- Give my current self space to be joyful and celebrate for the peace that I get to bask in
- Remove guilt of any kind for doing what is needed to protect my space (even if that means cutting off toxic family members)
- Give me vision for the kind of atmosphere that I would want for my kids one day
- Add an extra layer of self awareness 

This list could go on and on. So what am I saying? Should everyone move with haste to go live on their own? Well if the shoe fits then yeah lol. No. **What I am saying is this**:

> Get in a healthy environment. Whether that means you're living with a different family member, get some like minded roommates, decorate your space to make it your own, or live on your own, by all means, **do what needs to be done to make your space the best fit for you**

It'll change things. 

It'll sober you up. 

Your heart will awaken in ways you didn't think it could.

Cheers to home :wine_glass:, may we all experience its fulness.
