Last month, I was cleared to resume all normal physical activity post a shoulder injury. I was excited to resume swimming. But I was nervous about getting back in the gym. 

There were a myriad of reasons for the nerves: re injuring myself, making the somewhat resolved issue worse, scaling back, not being able to move as fast. All valid reasons. But none seemed to overpower the good. The gym brought stability, surges of endorphins and community. So I needed to get back to that life. As I had strayed far away. 

But I couldn't physically bring myself to show up. 

So I did the one thing that always seems harder to do in the moment. I asked for help. I reached out to a friend and explained all the things and asked if she would help me stay accountable to showing up.

### Ask for help

This has always been a personal struggle for me. Why the heck is it so hard to ask for help?

1. I feel like I can handle things on my own. Some of this is the residue of being self reliant for such a long time. My default was to fight. Fight till it gets done and by no means do you ask someone else. 

2. I was refusing to be the one **to accept the extended hand** because I deemed that person as less than. 

This all bubbles up into one word: arrogance. `Arrogance is usually what stands in the way of personal progress`. That, amongst other things. 

> Arrogance is characterized by an exaggerated sense of one's own importance or abilities. It often involves a lack of humility, an overbearing attitude, and a tendency to dismiss or undervalue others' opinions and contributions.

On the contrary, asking for help does not make me less. **It actually makes me more**. It makes me a better human. It also enables me to do other things well. It reminds me once again, that I was never created to be self reliant. 

### Get some accountability

Accountability is so powerful. Over the last 10 years of my life, it has been the thing that has helped to shape my integrity. `Accountability forces you to take responsibility for your actions and decisions along with their consequences.` This may seem daunting at first glance. But when done well, it truly is beautiful. 

The main question it answers is: **what can I do to help me stay on track in this area of my life?** I'll give some quick examples.

* I recently went on vacation and overspent by $200. To make up the difference, I am limiting my eating out this month to once a week. Consequence. Otherwise, I'd do the same thing again on the next trip. 

* From my gym example earlier, I asked my friend to attend classes with me. And to receive weekly check ins from me at the beginning of the week with my gym schedule (days and class times). This really has helped me to show up when I say I am because I don't want to waste her time. And if we need to change or move things around, we do. Having her in classes with me, also reminds me to tone it down. I can't move at the same pace. 

Accountability keeps you honest with yourself.

Thanks to this friend, I am back in the gym on a regular basis.

We all need help sometimes. Don't be afraid to reach out and ask. You'll be better off for it in the end.
