Whew! This has been quite the week :weary:. It started off on such a high with the end of a very stressful season (selling a house) but quickly shifted gears from relief to more stress, as another issue arose. In addition to this, work has been emotionally exhausting, with everyone on edge and full of anxiety over some major changes coming in the next week. And to put a damper on things, my sleep has been terrible.

It's been rough. 


I use a journaling app called Stoic (great app and very well done). As I attempted to document how awful I was feeling, I was prompted about it being **world gratitude day**. I was instantly navigated to a guided entry about gratefulness. 


As the week weighed heavily on me, gratitude was the last thing on my mind. And it was the last thing that I wanted to do. But I had to make a conscious decision to press in. And so I did.


<br>

> Gratitude is the feeling of appreciation or thankfulness for something received, whether tangible or intangible. It involves recognizing and valuing the positive aspects of life, people, or experiences, and **acknowledging the kindness, support, or benefits provided by others or yourself**

 <br>

**Gratitude begins with reflection and ends with acknowledgement.**

 <br>

 Upon my reflections this morning, I made several realizations. 
 
 I realized how strong and resilient I am. I have the ability to be a vault for myself and not just tend to my own emotions but carry them in a way a partner would, while also carrying things for others. I realized that my outward physical strength is such a resemblance of the power I hold within.

 I was so impressed by how much I was doing for me. **I then began thanking the hell outta myself** :sob: (acknowledgement). I was so grateful for me and all that I do. 
 
 I am a phenomenal human :brown_heart:. <br>


My next realization was how much I had to learn to be able to navigate all the complexities that arose with selling the house I mentioned earlier. There were so many challenges and legal things that came up. I realized that God gave me wisdom to not only ask the right questions but ask the right people or chatgpt (:laughing:). 

I thanked the Lord for giving me wisdom to know what to do and to think of quick solutions to problems that arose. I thanked him for putting friends in my life who connected me to the realtor we used. I thanked him for the ability to know how to research and for things like chatgpt that literally became my pocket real estate attorney (more acknowledgement). 

I then realized that I got to spend each night this week with a friend. Wether that was digitally or in person. This is never the case. I got to enjoy the company of people I care about. 

I am grateful for these friends! I am grateful that I get to share my life with some pretty awesome people. I am grateful for moments of shared understanding.

On Sunday nights, I like to have what I call, *"comfy chair prayer time"* :couch_and_lamp:. Where its just me and Jesus, talking about all the things. Usually what happens is, God will put a passage of scripture on my heart during my prayers. And this passage ends up being exactly what I need throughout the upcoming week, 100% of the time. It's my anchor of sorts :anchor:. 

This Sunday night, God put Philippians 4:6-7 on my mind. It reads as follows:

>6 Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, **and thank him for all he has done**. 7 **Then you will experience God’s peace**, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.

 Each time my stress and anxiety arose this week, once my mind was quiet, this passage played again and again. And in those moments I prayed, I explained the fears and the worries I had. But I fell short of giving thanks. 

This morning, as I pushed myself to press in to gratitude, I was amazed by how much a simple deed had such an effect on everything. 

I felt and still feel a peace that I can't quite comprehend with words. In an instant, it all became so clear to me. I am unsure of what is to come in this life, for me, for my family and all the things going on, for my career, for my dreams. But one thing I know for sure, is that **I will be ok**. Wether on this side of eternity or the next, I will be ok, **we'll be ok**. 

**`Gratitude gave me perspective.`**

I am so grateful that God anticipated my needs and gave me something to hold on to this week :purple_heart:. I'm also grateful for my journaling app and how spot on it was.

Idk about you but I am looking forward to the weekend. I will be lifting extra heavy :weight_lifting_woman: in the gym tonight, hanging with friends, having a costco hot dog and enjoying the life that I have been given.

What will you be doing this weekend?

 I encourage you to practice gratitude in some way. I don't care if you're thanking your cat or your dog for being your companion. <u>Make time for thoughtful reflection.</u> **`Find something to be grateful for and set your mind and thoughts on that.`** 
 
 <br>

Cheers to your weekend mate :wine_glass:, may it be ever so pleasant and full of peaceful armor.

Tawana J.
