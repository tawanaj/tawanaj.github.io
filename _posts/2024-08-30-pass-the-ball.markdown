I flew home for labor day weekend to spend some time with my fam! I thoroughly enjoyed lounging around, taking the occasional nap and brunching with my sisters :cocktail:! 

While I was away, I took note of how my body felt both inward and outward.
 
I felt an inward mental and emotional exhaustion. I found myself napping for longer than normal.  I'm not usually a napper but when I do nap, I know its my body's way of telling me it's exhausted :sleeping_bed:. 

 Up until that point, I had been juggling tons of different things, each in their own arena of life: work, day to day life things, family things, selling a house, managing contractors, still trying to prioritize myself and tending to friendships, planning trips and traveling. 
 
 Life has truly been **<u>BUSY</u>**. 

 It's no wonder my body took 3 hour naps when it had the chance :sleeping:.


One thing became very clear to me...

> **I am doing way too many things.**


 <h3 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">*****</h3>
Upon my realization, the first thing <u>I felt was angst.</u> 

Everything I was handling, seemed like a necessity. I made an excuse as to why every single thing on my plate had to be there. That went a little bit like this: 

> I like writing code, so owning several different features at the same time, seem reasonable and helps me to do what I enjoy. <br>
> I'm a homeowner and should probably tend to things that need my immediate attention. <br>
> It's my mom! I can't just not help her out. She needs help taking care of this house stuff. <br>
> I need people in this life, so hanging with friends is a must. 



I felt angst because there seemed to be no sign of relief. I was trying to keep everything tightly in my hands, all at the same time. 

The next thing <u>I felt was annoyance.</u> 

How in the world did I get to this point? It felt like I blinked and life suddenly became so crazy. I was annoyed with myself for stepping up or volunteering myself to do things. I was annoyed that I had to be the one figuring everything out all the time. 

 <h3 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">*****</h3>

Then I asked myself the following questions:
> Where are you saying yes, when you should be saying no?

Or better yet

> Where can you pass the ball? :volleyball:

I instantly thought about work. I knew that there were things that *I could put down but chose not to out of personal ambition*.

**PRIDE will get you every time.**

I was managing 2 features at the same time. This looked like writing the code, handling the release, coordinating with different teams, troubleshooting bugs as they came along and handling any other random thing that popped up. This is a lot to do for one feature. Multiply that by 2.

 I knew that I could tag in one of my teammates to tend to one of the features. But I didn't want to let it go. I felt like I had to be the one to finish it. I also didn't want someone else to get the glory for something that I did up until that point. 

**<u>PRIDE will get you every time.</u>**

I had to write that again for myself lol. 


While I understand my disposition, putting something down **does not symbolize weakness**. It actually symbolizes strength and wisdom :muscle::brain:. 

I am proud to say that I tagged in one of my teammates. And you know what I felt more than anything this week? <br><br>**Relief.**

And that friends is worth more than anything. 

Where can you say no? Do you need to be the one juggling the ball :baseball:? 
**<u>If not, pass the ball.</u>**

> How do you measure the fullness of your cup? Whats your gauge? :stopwatch:

My gauge is a culmination of a few things: the amount of naps I'm taking and for how long, the level of energy I have to do the things I enjoy and most importantly, **the number of times I context switch throughout the day**.

> Context switching refers to the process of shifting your focus between different tasks or activities, often requiring your brain to reset and refocus. 

Each time your brain switches to something new, there is a cognitive cost associated. Hence, why I was feeling the mental exhaustion that I mentioned earlier. 

I am multi task queen 	:crown:. I feel like I was made to multi task. And sometimes I'm not even multi tasking, I'm just getting a lot of things done in a day that are all vastly different. This can still cause a layer of mental exhaustion. Because your mind is still having to ramp up and ramp down to complete whatever task. 

I realized that **I can only have X number of things in flight on a given day**. Ideally, I'd like to just have one. But life as we know it, isn't that simple. So I took hold of my schedule and made some changes, shifted some things around, pushed some things back that weren't urgent and added in some breathing room. 

Interestingly enough, I found that the earth didn't shatter because X task wasn't completed as soon as possible. Or the world didn't stop because someone didn't get a quick response from me. 

Figure out how full your plate is :plate_with_cutlery:. **<u>What can you re arrange and save for later?</u>**

Life is busy. Don't let the business rule you. You have authority to take control of what is happening. 

The thing that may seem absolutely necessary, may not actually be so.

Cheers to the weekend :wine_glass:, may we save what can be done another day, for next, next Monday.
