My favorite teacher of all time, was my AP Literature teacher from junior year in high school, Mrs. Dinlocker.

Her class was known for being rigorous. Mrs. Dinlocker was known for being incredibly sweet and kind. She would hand you a 100 page reading :open_book: and writing assignment with a smile, calm demeanor, such warmth and care.

Her class made me a better pupil. She expected excellence from everyone despite the expectations that we set for ourselves. It taught me how to dig deep within myself. She taught me how to, "think like Nike and just do it", as she would usually say before giving assignments.

A few years into college, I reached out to Mrs. Dinlocker on Facebook and explained to her the impact that her class had on me and told her some of my post grad aspirations. She was elated to hear from me of course. In true Dinlocker fashion, she encouraged me to continue to push forward like Nike. Then she wished me the best and said:

> **Build a beautiful life for yourself Tawana**

I've been reminded of these words a lot these past few months. Specifically the concept of building. 

We're taught that if you work hard, it will pay off and you will get exactly what you put in. 

**I disagree.** 

**It is not enough to work hard.** At least for me it isn't.  
<br>

### I have to have a game plan.

You can grind all you want. But without an end goal, you're running in circles. 

And the result will be more hard work, forever.

Before any builder builds :construction:, they plan, or rather they follow architected designs approved by engineers and city officials. They have a blueprint to help guide what and how they build.

If life is meant to be built and curated, it requires planning. 

### I have to show up endlessly.    

It's easy for me to show up on days where things are going swimmingly. 

But when I show up to whatever, for whatever, when I least desire it, it matters a whole lot more. 

**Consistency.** Enough said. 
 

### I have to stay flexible :woman_dancing:.

I'm the purest definition of a type A person. I am a planner at heart. I genuinely dislike any resemblance of deviation. 

But as you and I both know, **everything WILL NOT always work out as you plan**. 

And that is ok. 

I need to be able to pivot and let go of my original blueprints, rather than stay crippled by the anxiety of having to pivot.

Here's an example of some building I'm doing currently.

Next year, I'd like to compete in my first weightlifting competition :weight_lifting_woman:. My game plan this year was to
- Get lean (put on muscle, trim fat)
- Eat well in a way that supports my lean goals 
- Sleep well (7 hours - 9 hours)
- Improve lift technique by attending barbell club at the gym each week
- Get in the gym 4 days a week 
- Have 2 days of active recovery (swim and hike on the weekends)

This was all good stuff. Until, I got injured earlier this year and had to pause all upper body lifting and extraneous exercise for an extended period of time. 

In true pivot fashion, instead of the gym, I increased my step count for the day and used my treadmill desk during the workday. I would go on longer and more frequent hikes. I loved this season. I had more time in the evenings. I was cooking more and enjoyed not having to be sore. 

After Physical Therapy, I was given the ok to return to the gym.

There were good days and there were bad days. The bad days, were a struggle to show up. I would often get discouraged with my own recovery and resent my body for the fact that I had to scale back. Those days, I would walk into the gym near to tears and would then find myself walking out, proud that I stayed. Not that I was somehow any less agitated lol. 

I loved this season even more. It forced me to do some serious soul searching and get to the root of some deep pride. **It was my mirror :mirror:.** I also loved being back in my gym community! I missed that more than the workouts. 

I have grown so much this year as an athlete and as a human in learning how to be patient and kind to my body.

As of this November, I am 5 pounds shy of my lean goal. I have seen a drastic increase in my stamina in my workouts. My body is locked into such a tight routine. I am stronger today than I ever have been in my entire life. I have recently pr'd my deadlift, backsquat and clean and jerk.

This is not to humble brag on my girl muscles :muscle: but this is a testament to <u>having a plan, staying consistent and flexing in a way that yields the same result.</u>


<h3 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">*****</h3>

I am forever grateful for Mrs. Dinlocker :brown_heart:. She changed my perspective. 

This year has been so full of beautiful moments, some I never even imagined I would ever have.

The life that I have built for myself is one that I didn't think to think of. **It is the fruit of a plan, consistency and pivots.**

Best wishes to you and I on our beautiful life building journeys :wine_glass:
