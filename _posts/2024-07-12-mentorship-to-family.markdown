I spent 4th of July visiting my mentor in Houston, Texas. I had such a great time catching up with her, spending time with her family, meeting her baby, being around other haitians and making new memories. 

While I was flying back, I took a moment to jot some things down in my journal. 

Something happened. 

I felt such deep gratitude for friends and for family. I was so moved by my mentors life, her friendship over the years, the way in which she lives life with her family and raising her tiny human(s). I felt like I was a part of that family. 

Let me back up.

When I was a freshman in high school, I joined this program at school called Upward Bound. It set out to prepare students for college. In the summer time, we would all get picked up from our schools and taken to FAU (a local university). There, we would prep for the SAT/ACT, talk about college as a whole, walk around the campus, meet different professors and also interact with different students. The last week of the program, we would actually live on campus in the dorms. 

In addition, each of us were paired with a current undergraduate student who would be our mentor throughout the duration of the program. 

That is how I met my mentor, Marjorie, in the summer of 2011. It's crazy to think how long ago that was and how different life is for the both of us. That one decision to join a program, would lead to what has become one of my longest friendships. She has played such a vital role in my development all around lol :sweat_smile:. Her and her husband have become voices of sound wisdom for me, even now. Especially when I am trying to decipher which money moves to make. There they are.

Going back to the moment I had on the plane earlier, as **I sat in remembrance, my heart was drenched with gratitude**. I was in awe of how  God had ordained both of our steps to cross paths. Yes life could have been lived had we not known each other but its so much richer with her in my life.

I was reminded of my oldest sister, Missy. Whom with her, I feel free to not have to be an adult (*amen to this*). Her protection of me is similar to that of a mom. I can show up at her doorstep and within moments, she'll be trying to feed me or whip something up for me to snack on. Because there's such a layer of safety, I can fall apart with her. She is notorious for switching back and forth between english and creole. Her expressions are hilarious and I find myself mimicking them.

That entire trip, I was bombarded by such a familiarity between my mentor and my oldest sister. They're both alike in many ways but I'm pretty sure I felt that because Marjorie is my family. She is just as much my sister as all my other sisters. Even with time and distance, her presence has remained constant.

* Family is not about blood relation. `Family really is about who you choose and who has been chosen to be in your life`. **I was chosen to be in my family. But I chose to be in relationship.** 
* **Remembrance will always make way for gratitude.** Gratitude has a way of taking our eyes off of the current and refocusing them to what will always be.

I am forever grateful for my chosen family :brown_heart:. I am grateful for divine alignment that brings us together. I am blessed.

May the rest of your week be full of family of every kind and remembrance :pray:
