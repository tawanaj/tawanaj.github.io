This week has been a very social week. Between various in and out of office work events, hanging with friends and being in the gym, I am socially tapped out. This weekend will surely be full of time alone to recharge and reflect. 

I used to be what they call an **introverted extrovert**, but as I have gotten older, I'm finding that I enjoy silence way too much to desire to be around people as much lol. 

Pure and utter silence. I know that a lot of this is because I live alone and can control the sounds in my home and when I want to hear them. But I've found such beauty in nothing at all but the stillness of the air. 

I love the tranquility that the morning brings. I try to have tea in the backyard and just take in the sound of the  breeze, birds chirping, grasshoppers in the distance and the suns effervescence :sunny:. It's a beautiful sound.

Life is **<u>LOUD</u>**. On a daily basis it can be deafening. 

The things around us, are constantly amplifying. From a societal perspective, there's social media, tik tok, the news, political climate and misinformation that seems to rile everyone up. Then there's the noise from our own lives that seemingly get louder as the week progresses. Be it household duties, hobbies, stressful work situations or environments, family, children, teenagers, maintaining friendships, financial stress and hardships, the list could go on for days.

We're like headphones, where life is the constant playlist playing through the speakers. Every beat and tune, all affecting us. 

Silence is not normalized enough. Sitting with just the quiet of your own self, no phone, no selfies documenting the sitting, is not something we prioritize. It goes against the grain of what we know. Why is that?

> Could it be we're afraid of what will come up? Or is it simply that we haven't tried to just sit with nothing?

After college, I moved to Nashville and started my first big girl job. I was in a new city, new environment and had gotten my first solo apartment. There was a massive adjustment period to post college life. I actually had time to do things. There was so much time, a little too much time lol.

I was experiencing silence for the first time and it was incredibly uncomfortable. I didn't know what to do with myself with there not being so much noise around me.

Knowing what I know now, I realize that a huge source of my discomfort, came from the fact that I was not ok within myself. **I didn't know who I was.** I also didn't like who I was.
> **How could I be comfortable with sitting alone with someone I didn't recognize or enjoy?**

The other thing I realized, was that I never had a chance to internalize my own inner chaos. There were so many open wounds that had never been tended to, just masked as healed from the noise of what my reality was at the time. 

So I found outward ways to make life loud again. I was hanging out with friends. I heavily indulged in social media and would revolve my life around it. I got plugged into a church and started serving. I started traveling with friends.

While all these were GREAT things to do (minus the social media indulgence), I was just numbing myself. **Trying to escape the fact that deep down I wasn't comfortable with just me.**

Fast forward to now.

I enjoy **just being**. Fully embracing my inner quiet and the silence that life brings. Instead of trying to run from it, I excitingly indulge :yum:. Wether that means I'm reading in my comfy chair in my office, watching the sunrise or sunset, people watching my neighbors, I don't need noise or sounds of any kind to entertain me. **I can just be.** 

I decided to look up some benefits of sitting in silence and turns out there's a whole lotta good. 

> Silence allows your mind to unwind and can help lower cortisol levels, the hormone associated with stress.

> Silence enhances focus and brings in a layer of clarity.

> Silence could contribute to a higher level of self awareness.

> Silence helps to process raw emotions, helping you to be a healthier emotional human.

> Silence spurs up creativity.

> Sitting in silence can lower your blood pressure.

While I enjoy time with people, I enjoy time alone more. That doesn't mean that social interactions have to be weird. I love being with my people :purple_heart:. I also love just being with Tawana :brown_heart:. 


Here's to you, may you enjoy time in peaceful stillness while still being able to enjoy the company of those you value most. 


Cheers to the weekend :cocktail:,
