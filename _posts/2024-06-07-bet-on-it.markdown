I've recently started reading Shoe Dog, based on the creator of Nike, Phil Knight. It has been an enjoyable read so far. 
(I'll follow up once I finish). In the first few chapters, he sets the scene of how he started his shoe empire based in 1962-1965.

#### **Spark notes**
- Phil is a recent Stanford business school grad
- He ran track in undergrad at University of Oregon with the famous Bill Bowerman as his coach
- His father was a well known lawyer
- Since university, he longs to pitch a major business idea to the shoe manufacturers of Tiger (based in Japan)
- After graduation, he goes on a worldwide tour, eventually making it to Japan.
- His father gets hims connected to some guys he knew in Tokyo, who then connects him to some other guys who had been living in Japan for some time.

Phil sets up a meeting with executives of the shoe manufacturer.

His connections give him cultural advice on how to approach doing business in Japan. They also make him aware of mannerisms and body language in order to gauge how his meeting goes.

`Wow.`

So first off, he's able to get a meeting with major executives **with no reputation**. His connections are able to help him culturally prepare. But that's about it.

What gets me is what happens next...

During said meeting, he pitches that there is untapped potential in the american west coast market for the Tiger shoe.  The numbers he uses to prove market potential, were based off his graduate thesis that he spent years doing methodical research. 


> At one point, he suggests to the executives that they could make ***upwards of a billion dollars if they expanded their market***. And he could help make it happen. All he needed was x number of samples to sale.

This is a **24 year old** with 
- little to no sales experience
- no working business experience
- no legal experience
- no importing experience

And also, this is post *world war II*. The tensions are **THICK** between the US and Japan. 

Every card is stacked against this guy on paper. The executives have no reason to accept this amateur proposal. And also  that billion dollar number came out of thin air.. :skull: lol. 

It does not look good. <br><br>


But something happens..

The executives actually hear him out. Once he throws out that billion dollar number as potential profits, it sets things off. ***The executives then start to pitch to HIM.***

How crazy is that? Any tension that was present, went out the window. **Money was now on the line.** They saw an opportunity.

Alright. Alright. Why'd I go on this long rant? 

Despite it being a completely different time all together, there are a couple things that we can all learn here:


1. Folks, :speaking_head: **you can do anything you put your mind to**. <br><br>
      The only thing holding you back is you. It all begins and ends with belief in yourself.

2. Audacity will take you far. <br><br>
`Audacity` is what drives you to market yourself well. It is taking a risk. It is welcoming new ideas. It is getting out of your comfort zone and branching off into an entirely new space. It is saying yes to the things that scare the hell out of you.

3. **Passion will out**. <br><br>
Passion drives the why. It fuels your inner desire to do things, or get back up again when you fail. If you aren't passionate about something, it'll soon rear its head. When was the last time you asked yourself any of the following questions: ***what fuels me, what brought me joy today, did I enjoy doing that***. `Make space for passion.` It may not always pay the bills but it could be a gauge of how far you're straying from your center.


4. Sometimes it really has **nothing** to do with what you know but about who you know. <br><br>
Connections connections. When was the last time you networked in a room full of humans? I am not talking about attending an event and heading out at the end. When was the last time you had a meaningful professional connection? Put yourself back out there. You have something to offer (also doubles as good dating advice lol).

I leave you with this: 

`You will out`. Bet on yourself.
