In the last several years, I have accumulated over 60 house plants. I'm not sure how I got to this number and when, but I love my plant children :potted_plant:. About 30% of them are some variation of a Pothos plant.


Pothos plants belong to the Araceae, or Arum family.


> The **<u>Araceae</u>** are a family of flowering plants where the flowers grow on a structure called a spadix, often surrounded or partly covered by a leaf-like bract called a spathe.

### **Golden Pothos**

Golden Pothos are by far one of the most popular house plants around the world. They are visually pleasing to the eye and require minimally little effort to keep alive.

They are considered to be "true" pothos. In that, they fall under the **genus Epipremnum**, more specifically, **Epipremnum aureum** and have glossy green leaves.

They are native to the Islands of French Polynesia. *If you are geographically challenged like I am, this is deep in the south pacific ocean, midway between New Zealand and Chile.*

**Golden Pothos require indirect bright light.** These are great plants for that high shelf you might have in your kitchen. Because the vines can grow pretty long, they should be located in a place that won't stifle their growth.

**Golden Pothos will kinda tell you when they need water.** They get droopy and sad when their soil is extremely dry. I spoil my plants and water them once a week. Depending on the season, the frequency of waterings could change. During winter and fall, you could probably get away with watering less frequently as the air is dry. While summer and spring, will require more frequent waterings. I've been able to go as long as 3 weeks without watering my Pothos in the winter. 

**Your plants have personalities. Get to know them. Figure out what they like and what they don't like.** For example, one of my Pothos, Ted (pictured below), loves for his soil to be drenched and moist at all times. He will throw a fit and get all droopy if not. To each their own.

Fun fact:
> **Golden Pothos are great for purifying the air.** They work behind the scenes to absorb chemicals like formaldehyde, benzene and carbon monoxide and break them down with their leaves, all while looking very aesthetically pleasing

No so fun fact:
>  **Golden Pothos are toxic to both pets and tiny humans (NO EATING)**. Due to the air purifying nature of these plants, the toxins live in the leaves. You may want to keep these out of reach or on high shelves.

Siblings in the Arum family are known as Aroids.

### **Satin Pothos**

Satin Pothos are known for their pretty dark green leaves with striking silver spots. They are truly handsome plants. 

Satin Pothos are also in the Araceae family and are the aroid of the Golden Pothos. Contrary to popular belief, **Satin Pothos are not considered to be true Pothos, though it's in the name.** They fall under the **genus Scindapsus**. 

They are native to Southeast Asia, more specifically, India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippians and Indonesia. Ok, I want to admit that I didn't realize Bangladesh was a country on it's own :flushed:.

Vine plants in general are great plants for propagation. They grow extremely well in water. I have propagated several Pothos in water. Once the roots grow, I'll either pot them in soil or keep them in water.

**Fun fact:** Vine plants in general can grow up to 40ft indoors and can surpass these lengths when grown outdoors :astonished:
