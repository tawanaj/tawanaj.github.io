A few days ago, my camera roll brought up the wildest throwback photo. I was so caught off guard. Like, how dare you phone. 

But then after looking at the photo intently. I laughed. The memories started flooding in. I went back to where I was when the photo was taken. I thought of the friends who were around me at the time. I thought of where I was living, my little college dorm. I thought about the overall season of life I was in. And most importantly, how far I'd come. 

`I instantly felt such compassion for my younger self`. I had to pause what I was doing and make space for what I was feeling :brown_heart:. 

Funny enough, that compassion carried over into my present day. I gave myself a whole lot of grace that day to just do and be. 

> Self-compassion involves treating yourself with the same kindness, understanding, and care that you would offer to a good friend or loved one.

### When was the last time you practiced self compassion? 

We are so quick to retaliate/act in situations. That sometimes we don't give ourselves adequate room for proper understanding, care and grace. 

- **Kindness is allotting time to explore the root of your emotions.**<br>
- Grace is being ok with whatever comes up, knowing that you're strong enough to handle it. <br>
- Understanding is grasping the full scope of what has happened **with complete context**.   

Self compassion doesn't come easy for me. I have to work hard to not militantly go through my day, pushing everything aside to get things done. But I have found that the following things have helped me put self compassion into practice:

#### 1. Journal <br>
Journaling helps me to truly talk things out with myself and with God :pray:. It helps me to gauge how far I am from what my normal is. These are some of the normal questions that go through my mind as I journal. 
> How am I doing today? What brought me joy? Why did I retaliate this way? Why is this making me so irritated?

#### 2. Speak to that younger self of yours <br>
Often times our behavior has nothing to do with who we are right now but who we were. **Learn how to acknowledge that younger part of you.** If she was reading this, my therapist would be immensely proud right now. 

#### 3. Make space <br>
Make space for your emotions. Don't just set your feelings by the way side and hope like hell everything turns out ok. Acknowledge where you are and what has happened. And sit with whatever comes up. Like a wave, **let it smash over you**, knowing that you are strong enough to get up again. And again like a wave, the emotion doesn't have to take you out because you are making space to feel it.`But the only way through, is through.` You have to feel it.

Be kind to you. Shower yourself with the same level of compassion as you would anyone else. 


I am hugging myself extra tight tonight. For a myriad of reasons. But mainly because I am so proud of me. All of me.

Hugs from afar, <br>
