I have been wanting to pull the trigger on this blog for a while. But I have been so slow to move on it, coming up with 100 different scenerios as to why this will not be a good idea or that I won't have enough ideas to write about or how this will fail or wondering if anyone will ever read it and the list goes on.

`Analysis paralysis` is when we overthink and overanalyze a situation to the point where we are paralyzed from ever making a decision or taking action.

This morning I had a flash back to when I was under one of my previous managers a couple years ago. Being under his leaderhsip was the first time in my professional career that I felt like I would never have what it takes to be a great software engineer. I'll never forget one of our meetings where he told me that I was not an expert and even chuckled a little bit when he said it. I remember walking away from that encounter feeling so defeated. I felt like nothing I would ever do would matter. He had an idea of what he thought an engineer should do and be and to me it felt like I would never foot the bill. <br>

I let his words get to me. And for a better part of a year and a half, I second guessed myself to no end. It affected my ability to code, to come up with solutions to problems that I was already familiar with, to present solutions to the team out of fear that I would never be good enough.

`I was already enough.` Whatever that means lol. 
 
It's funny that we give so much power to other people but not to ourselves. For me, I gave him way too much power. Pardon my french. `I was fuckin dope.` I still am. And will always be. If I had let his words stop me, I would have never become the badass that I am. Our relationship got a lot better in time. Working with him, was actually one of the most necessary seasons of my career. ***I'll expand on this a bit more in a future post***.

In summary, there will always be a reason to not do something. For some of us, it goes deeper than normal fear. You might have a literal voice in the back of your head spinning narratives that are telling you all the reasons why you will never be good enough. Those voices are sometimes an echo being replayed in your subconscious. Voices that had no basis, right, or motive to say what is being said. And even if it did, you are not who were. You are who you are right now in this moment. <br>

Many people say they have a fear of failure and that is what prevents most of us from taking risks. I think it's actually a fear of starting. Today I write. To ***hell*** with the voices and the reasons! `Let's go get em`
