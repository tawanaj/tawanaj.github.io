Hello mate :wave:,

My name is Tawana Jerome. I am so glad you stopped by! Welcome to the ultimate brain dump, well, more like emotional dump. My hope is that this will truly be an oasis for not just me but for others. In it, I share some of my personal experiences and insight in all different avenues of life: travel, career, family, plant care, cooking, faith, fitness. So, buckle up.

I am your typical boring adult. You can usually find me at home taking care of my various plant children, cooking a yummy dish, getting a workout in at my local Crossfit gym or gallivanting the earth. I currently live in Nashville, TN where I work as a software engineer. But I am originally from Ft. Lauderdale, FL. I am the youngest of lots and lots of humans lol thanks to my dad. My parents migrated to the states from Haiti :haiti: (***moun mwen yo, sa kap fet :heart:***) a couple years before they had me.

I gave my life to Jesus when I was about 10 years old and what a journey it has been. I look forward to sharing some of these adventures.

I hope that you feel comfy and safe here. And know that, you matter. If you find that you resonate with anything, I would love to hear from you. 

xoxo,
