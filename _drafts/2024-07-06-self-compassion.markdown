A few days ago, my camera roll brought up the wildest throwback photo. I was so caught off guard. Like, how dare you phone. 

But then after looking at the photo intently. I laughed. The memories started flooding in. I went back to where I was when the photo was taken. I thought of the friends who were around me at the time. I thought of where I was living at the time. I thought about the overall season of life I was in. And most importantly, how far I'd come. 

`I instantly felt such self compassion for my younger self`. I had to pause what I was doing and make space for what I was feeling. 

Funny enough, that compassion carried over into my present day. I gave myself grace to just do and be. 

### When was the last time you practiced self compassion? 

> Self-compassion involves treating yourself with the same kindness, understanding, and care that you would offer to a good friend or loved one.

We are so quick to retaliate/act in situations. And sometimes we don't give ourselves adequate room for proper understanding, care and grace. 

- **Kindness is allotting time to explore the root of your emotions.**<br>
- Grace is being ok with whatever comes up. <br>
- Understanding is grasping the full scope of what has happened **with complete context**.   

Be kind to you. Shower yourself with the same level of compassion as you would anyone else.

I am hugging myself extra tight tonight. For a myriad of reasons. But mainly because I am so proud of me.
