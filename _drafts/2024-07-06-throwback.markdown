Over the last few days, my camera roll has been bringing up the wildest throwback pictures. Some more embarrassing than others. My first reaction when I see an old photo is to hesitate. Like act like I didn't just open this up lol.

But then it is usually filled with remembrance. I go back to where I was when the photo was taken. I think about what was happening around that time in my life. I remember some of the people who were in my life at the time. I think about the overall season of life I was in. How far I've come. How much I could never relate to the person in the photo. 

2 things happen when I look back:  

I am filled with the deepest gratitude. Grateful to God for keeping through all the turbulence. Grateful  

Looking back at how far you've come can work wonders! Becuase of how pre occupied we are these days with everyone elses lives via social media, we often forget about our own. 

Looking back gives you perspective. Higher perspective to see far above and beyond your cu

Looking back can also stir up some inner drama! Boy do I know this all too well. Regret. Shame. Guilt. Fear. Grief. 




Have you ever looked at an old photo or heard a song that brought back a well of memories? Maybe they were great memories of some pivotal times in your life. Or maybe they were painful memories that somehow take your breath away at first thought. 

About 3 years ago, I started having panic attacks again. Back when I was in college they would creep up on me during really stressful weeks as I juggled school, work and personal life. But these attacks were very different than the ones I was used to. 

I was waking up in cold sweats, having night terrors, I would wake up in the middle of the night unable to breath and hyperventilating scared out of my mind that I was going to die. 

Let me back up a little. About 2 years before the panic attacks began, my childhood best friend and I had a falling out. Things ended terribly between us. It was one of those things that you never see coming. But at the time of our friendship ending, my personal/family life was buck wild. So many things were happening all in that one season. A rough breakup, a mentor's betrayl, I was looking after my mom who had been in a depressive state brought on by other things, my uncle passed away, oh yeah then there was COVID. 

Ya girl was backed up. So many things to process back to back. Internally, I think to cope with eveyrthing, I stuffed as much as I could deep deep down. Deep enough where I could still function at the capacity that I needed too. 

In time, the very thing I was stuffing down, soon came back up. Only this time I was greeted in my dreams. The dreams were vivid. In them, a major life event would be taking place: engagements, weddings, kids, baby showers. Mid way through the ceremony, the realization would come that this childhood friend wasn't there. Or I wasn't there for hers. What was a joyous occasion in the dream turned into panic, angst, shortness of breath, sweating, in the dream I would fall over. Then I would wake up in the middle of the night in tears, sweating, anxiously realizing that the dream wasn't a dream but my new reality. 

These went on for about 4 months.
